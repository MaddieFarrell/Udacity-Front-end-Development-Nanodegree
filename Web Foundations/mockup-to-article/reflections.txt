Your response goes here!
1. Some new skills that I learned was making some words not bolded with span. Also using strike was new to me too.
2. Making all the headers, the paragraphs and the image was easy to me.
3. The most difficult thing for me was to make “By” in the second header have a normal font.
4. So problem solving strategies was to organize my code and figure out how what needs to be a link or italicized. Also taking a break once in a while helped me clear my head.
